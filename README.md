# Python and ML Resources

Welcome to a collection of Python and Machine Learning resources. 

The documents have been redacted in places but mostly are the output of a GPT 3 model. 

Large Language Models like GPT 3 might [hallucinate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)#:~:text=AI%20hallucination%20gained%20prominence%20around,falsehoods%20within%20its%20generated%20content.) and give incorrect information, please use your own judgement when reading these materials and conduct further research to verify any information you find.


The resources include:

- [Statistics for ML in 30 minutes](./stats-for-ml-in-30-minutes.md)
- [SQLAlchemy in 10 minutes](./sqlalchemy-in-10-minutes.md)
